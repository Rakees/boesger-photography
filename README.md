# Bösger Photography

Welcome to the official GitHub page of **Bösger Photography**! This website is a portfolio of my work as a street and event photographer. It was created with the goal of showcasing my best works and providing visitors with an immersive experience.

## About the Website

This website is based on a fork of the **Photorama** theme, which was specifically designed for photographers and artists. Photorama offers a minimalist and elegant design, perfect for showcasing images. I have customized the theme to reflect my personal style and requirements.

## Credits

This project is a fork of the [Photorama](https://github.com/sunbliss/photorama) theme, developed by **Filippo Oretti** and **Dario Andrei**. Many thanks to the original developers for their great work!
