    <h1>My Photography Journey</h1>
    <p>Since 2020, I have been actively pursuing photography as a hobby, focusing on street photography, events, and
      weddings for friends.</p>
    <p>Driven by my travels and the urge to discover something new, I have journeyed extensively in recent years to
      capture the world’s moments. Equipped with my Sony Alpha 7 III, a variety of lenses, filters, and refined
      technical skills, I am well-prepared for many shooting scenarios and eventualities.</p>

<h1>What I Offer</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Photography and photo editing services offered freely; I ask only for coverage of travel, accommodation, and
    meals.</li>
  <li>Worldwide availability for one-day events.</li>
  <li>Delivery of carefully selected and fully edited images post-event.</li>
  <li>Adaptable style tailored to each client’s preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Why I Do It</h1>
<p>As a remote software developer with a stable income, I travel the world as a digital nomad to explore new cultures
  and meet
  people, pursuing my passion for photography.</p>
<p>I am fully aware of how expensive photographers can be and that my services are a nice bonus and motivating factor in
  my photography.</p>
<p>I focus on quality rather than quantity, which is why I plan for only one to two events per month. Taking on more
  assignments would risk compromising either my primary work as a software developer or the quality of the final images.
  Let this be another reason why I am the right choice for you and your event.</p>
