      Since 2020, I have been actively pursuing photography as a hobby, focusing on street photography, events, and
      weddings for friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driven by my travels and the urge to discover something new, I have journeyed extensively in recent years to
      capture the world’s moments. Equipped with my Sony Alpha 7 III, a variety of lenses, filters, and refined
      technical skills, I am well-prepared for many shooting scenarios and eventualities.
