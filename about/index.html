  My name is <b>Phillip Bösger</b>, born in 1997, and I am a German photographer passionate about capturing life’s
  moments around the world.

    <h1 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My Photography Journey</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
      Since 2020, I have been actively pursuing photography as a hobby, focusing on street photography, events, and
      weddings for friends.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
      Driven by my travels and the urge to discover something new, I have journeyed extensively in recent years to
      capture the world’s moments. Equipped with my Sony Alpha 7 III, a variety of lenses, filters, and refined
      technical skills, I am well-prepared for many shooting scenarios and eventualities.

<h1 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">What I Offer</h1>
<ul style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2em;">
  <li>Photography and photo editing services offered freely; I ask only for coverage of travel, accommodation, and
    meals.</li>
  <li>Worldwide availability for one-day events.</li>
  <li>Delivery of carefully selected and fully edited images post-event.</li>
  <li>Adaptable style tailored to each client’s preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="font-size: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Why I Do It</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  As a remote software developer with a stable income, I travel the world as a digital nomad to explore new cultures
  and meet people, pursuing my passion for photography.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  I am fully aware of how expensive photographers can be and that my services are a nice bonus and motivating factor in
  my photography.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8; text-align: justify;">
  I focus on quality rather than quantity, which is why I plan for only one to two events per month. Taking on more
  assignments would risk compromising either my primary work as a software developer or the quality of the final images.
  Let this be another reason why I am the right choice for you and your event.
